This project is the BankOCR Kata, written in Groovy.  More information on the kata itself can be found at http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR.

Please note - this project is built using Gradle, and as such will need: 
-A working installation of Gradle (preferably the most recent production version); and
-An appropriate version of Java installed.

The following reports are available (in the reports directory):
-Cobertura (coverage)
-Code Metrics (metrics)
-Test Results (test-results)

A recent version of the metrics will be checked into the repo, but the reports can be run locally using the command 'gradle metrics'.

In addition, 'gradle test' can be used to run the test suite, and 'gradle build' will run a complete build.
